DA-Python-Project 📊
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing the Telco Customer Churn Dataset to identify key factors that contribute to customer churn. The goal is to apply data analysis techniques in Python to extract insights, visualize patterns, and build a foundation for predictive modeling.

It is part of my learning journey in Data Analytics and Python projects.


📂 Dataset

Source: Telco Customer Churn dataset (uploaded in this repository).

Description: The dataset contains customer demographic information, account details, and services used. The target variable is Churn (Yes/No), indicating whether the customer left the company.



⚙️ Tech Stack / Tools

Programming: Python

Libraries Used:

pandas (data manipulation)

numpy (numerical analysis)

matplotlib & seaborn (visualization)

scikit-learn (for preprocessing and basic ML)


🔎 Project Workflow

Data Loading & Cleaning

Handle missing values and data types.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Univariate & bivariate analysis.

Churn distribution and feature relationships.


Visualization

Correlation heatmaps, bar plots, histograms.

Insights & Key Findings

Identify patterns and high churn-risk groups.


📈 Results (so far)

Cleaned and explored the dataset.

Visualized customer churn trends.

Identified potential drivers of churn (like contract type, tenure, and monthly charges).
